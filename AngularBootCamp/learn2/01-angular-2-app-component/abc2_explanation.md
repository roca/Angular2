# abc2.js - Development tooling suitable for class

You might be curious what is inside the file abc2.js. Sometimes in
class we colloquially describe it as "magic", but actually it is a
combination and use of these technologies:

* TypeScript compiler
* SystemJS
* JSPM
* Lodash
* Angular
* NgRx
* Other minor libraries
* Other miscellaneous pieces

abc2.js is most similar to the configuration provided by the "quick
start" described and used and linked from Angular.io. It serves the
needs in class quite well, because it minimizes any need for
server-side tooling while we all make it through Angular itself.
